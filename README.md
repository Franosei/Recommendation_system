# Recommendation_system
n this project, I utilized Scala to develop a music recommendation system using the Audioscrobbler dataset. The goal of the project was to create a personalized music recommendation engine that suggests relevant songs to users based on their listening preferences.

The Audioscrobbler dataset contains a large collection of user listening histories, including information about the songs they have listened to and their corresponding play counts. This dataset served as the foundation for building the recommendation system.

To begin, I processed the Audioscrobbler dataset using Scala to extract and preprocess the relevant information. This involved cleaning and transforming the data into a suitable format for modeling and analysis.

Next, I implemented collaborative filtering techniques, such as user-based or item-based collaborative filtering, to generate recommendations. Collaborative filtering leverages the listening patterns and preferences of users to identify similar users or similar songs and make recommendations based on those similarities.

Using Scala's robust libraries and frameworks for machine learning and recommendation systems, I built and trained a recommendation model on the preprocessed data. This model learned from the user listening histories and utilized various algorithms and techniques to identify patterns, similarities, and correlations between users and songs.

Finally, I evaluated the performance of the recommendation system by measuring its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting user preferences. I utilized evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision to assess the quality of the recommendations.

Overall, this project showcased the use of Scala in developing a music recommendation system based on the Audioscrobbler dataset. By leveraging collaborative filtering techniques and Scala's powerful libraries, I was able to create a system that could suggest relevant music to users based on their listening habits and preferences.
